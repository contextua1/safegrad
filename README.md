```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/safegrad
cd safegrad

cargo run                      # Help message and basic functionality test
cargo run --bin basic_demo     # Basic operations and backpropagation
cargo run --bin xor_demo       # XOR neural network training  
cargo run --bin sin_demo       # Sine function approximation
```
